    "The problem / challenge addressed in this report and study is a very personal one; the target audience is myself and my future wife and family. Therefore, this 'business problem' is a fairly unconventional one, as I am performing this study for myself as the main stakeholder. I'll attempt to keep personal details and information minimal throughout this report, however as a natural consequence of the subject matter I will occasionally reference items of personal interest.\n",
    "\n",
    "I met my fiance over 5 years ago in Ottawa, Canada, whilst I was working in the area on on a business trip. I live in England, and work as a system development manager and engineer, and frequently have to travel abroad for client site visits and buisness meetings. Our long-distance relationship has developed to the point where we our now engaged, and I am actively trying to immigrate to Canada so we can seriously start our life together. \n",
    "\n",
    "Moving to another country is a daunting prospect, and one that merits time and research into identifying the best area for both of us. Naturally, I am very anxious (but also excited) for what the future holds - this project represents a very real, genuine attempt to evaluate some areas that will maximise the chance of our move and choice being a success.\n",
    "\n",
    "The minimum criteria for us is as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Within a 60 minute drive (approximately 70 km) of Smiths Falls, Ontario (this is where my fiance currently works).\n",
    "2. We do not want to live in Quebec.\n",
    "3. We cannot live in the United States (Smiths Falls is relatively close to the border).\n",
    "4. We do not want to live in a very small town - the town / city must contain more than 2,500 residents.\n",
    "5. We do not want to live in a major city or urban area - the town / city must contain less than 50,000 residents.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Providing the above minimum criteria are met, towns / cities / neighboorhoods will be ranked using the following attributes:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The amount of restuarants in the town / city (excluding fast food restuarants) - high priority.\n",
    "2. The amount of bars in the town / city - high priority.\n",
    "3. The amount of gyms / fitness studios in the town / city - medium priority.\n",
    "4. The amount of entertainment venues in the town / city - medium priority.\n",
    "5. The amount of outdoor spaces, such as parks and trails in the town / city - medium priority.\n",
    "6. The amount of shopping outlets and retail stores - low priority.\n",
    "7. The distance from Smiths Falls, Ontario - high priority.\n",
    "\n",
    "With the above critieria evaluated we will hopefully be able to identify some suitable areas for us to move to when I immigrate, to maximise the chance of our future life together being happy and successful."

    "The source data for this problem will be acquired from [Distantias's location proximity tool](https://www.distantias.com/towns-radius-smiths_falls-ontario-canada.htm). This website provides an easy-to-use tool which can quickly search for all towns, cities and habitated places in proximity to another town or place. It then provides the location data in a convenient .csv file which will be easy to process for the study. Unfortunately, this tool also charges a small fee to use. Despite a thorough search for equivalent libraries / functions and data sources, the ease of which this tool provides outweighed the negative aspect of a small extra charge to access the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The reliability of this data seems very good, with transparency about some population data that may be missing from the returned query: *'We don't have data for every town and city in Canada and we specify this with NA in our data table. Population data is sourced from a variety of national and international databases some of which are more current than others. The oldest data set is from 2011 but we do make ongoing updates as new census data is released'.* With this in mind, a provisional review of my queried data did indeed contain hamlets and settlements with no population data; evaluating these manually showed that the settlements are so tiny that no census data has ever been collected from them. Therefore these can be simply dropped from the data as they do not fulfill critierium 4 as detailed above.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data will then be leveraged using foresquare in order to evaluate the areas, towns, cities and neighborhoods that meet the minimum acceptable criteria. This Foresquare location and venues data will then be used to evaluate our preffered neighborhood attributes.\n",
    "\n",
    "This data can be called to provide lots of meaningful and revelant information - for instance it can be used to examine and cluster the frequency of various amneties in an area, as shown by the following results from a previous and related exercise:\n",

    "![alt text](https://github.com/ShaunDiplock/Coursera_Capstone/blob/main/Neighborhood%20data%20example.PNG?raw=true \"Example clustered neighborhood data\")\n",

    "Ultimately, I will be using all of this data to assign each area a 'weighted score' to help form a list of the best three suitable neighborhoods, with some final discussion about the pros and cons of each area."

Reffering back to our initial attributes we wish to rate the Towns by, we need to re-classify these specific venue types into general ones to be able to evaluate the amount that each Town contains. The six categories we are interested in ranking are restuarants (excluding fast food restaurants or similiar, which will be classed as 'Other'), bars, fitness venues, entertainment venues, outdoor spaces and shopping outlets. Therefore, the unique categories need to be re-classified as follows for us to use them:\n",
